# EHentai Node Configuration

node:
  # Unique identifier for this node (e.g., "node-001", "node-alice")
  id: "node-001"

  # ED25519 signature (Base64 encoded)
  # Contact the platform maintainer to get your node ID and signature
  signature: "SIGNATURE_HERE"

server:
  # WebSocket server URL
  # Example: ws://localhost:8080/ws or wss://example.com/ws
  url: "ws://localhost:8080/ws"

ehentai:
  # EHentai cookie for authentication
  # Format: ipb_member_id=XXXXX; ipb_pass_hash=XXXXXXXXX
  # You can get this from your browser's developer tools when logged into e-hentai.org
  cookie: ""

  # Whether to use ExHentai instead of E-Hentai
  # Note: ExHentai requires additional setup and access
  use_exhentai: false

  # Maximum GP cost per day
  # Set to -1 for unlimited
  # This helps control daily spending
  max_gp_cost: -1

database:
  # SQLite database path for storing parse logs
  # Default: ./data/ehentai.db
  path: "./data/ehentai.db"

task:
  # Base balance threshold for dynamic claim delay (in GP)
  # Nodes with balance >= this value will claim tasks immediately (0 delay)
  # Nodes with lower balance will have progressively longer delays
  # This helps protect low-balance nodes from hitting the GP reserve threshold
  # Uses quadratic function for non-linear delay: high balance = minimal delay, low balance = strong protection
  # Default: 1000000
  base_balance_gp: 1000000

  # Maximum claim delay for low-balance nodes (in seconds)
  # Nodes at the GP reserve threshold will wait this long before claiming
  # Nodes with balance between reserve and base_balance_gp will have delays
  # calculated via quadratic interpolation (delay increases rapidly near reserve)
  # Default: 1
  base_claim_delay: 1

dashboard:
  # Enable the web dashboard for monitoring node status
  enabled: true

  # Dashboard HTTP server address
  # Format: :port or host:port
  # Default: :8090 (avoid conflict with server on :8080)
  address: ":8090"
